# Example Python Scripts for Raspberry Pi with the LED-Matrix

Trying to learn python and better understand how to use the pi Matrix. Based partially on [mikemountain/nfl-led-scoreboard](https://github.com/mikemountain/nfl-led-scoreboard)

## Installation

This project relies on standard Python libraries, and you don't need to install any external dependencies. The `time` module, which is used for time-related operations, is included in the Python standard library, so there's no need to install it separately.

To install the required dependencies, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use this project with the RGB LED matrix, you'll need to clone the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` repository into your Raspberry Pi.

1. Clone the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.git
   ```

For more information about the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` library, including detailed documentation and configuration options, please visit the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix repository](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix).

## Make sure to change the API key in weather
