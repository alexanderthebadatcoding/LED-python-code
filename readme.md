# Example Python Scripts for Raspberry Pi with the LED-Matrix

## Installation

This project relies on standard Python libraries, and you don't need to install any external dependencies. The `time` module, which is used for time-related operations, is included in the Python standard library, so there's no need to install it separately.

To install the required dependencies, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
